# Hello-World-
Web Development 
My Name is Angela Reid, but everyone calls me Angie.  I have worked as a Programmer Analyst is the past.
I have taken classes in Web Development to hopefully return to a career in information technology.  I
have taken PHP, JavaScript, CSS, XHTML, XML, Intro to ASP.NET using C#.  My desire is to continue learning
and improving my skills by expanding on projects I did in class, working on volunteer projects, and creating 
new development.
